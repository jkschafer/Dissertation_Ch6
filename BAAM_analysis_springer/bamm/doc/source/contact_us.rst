==========

Please post any questions, comments, suggestions, possible bugs, etc. to our
`BAMM Google Groups <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bamm-project>`_
page or (for bug reports) to our `GitHub <https://github.com/macroevolution/bamm>`_  forum. You may also contact us directly:
Dan Rabosky <drabosky@umich.edu>.

If you are reporting a problem, please include (if possible) the data files
that led to the problem, the control file, and as much information as possible
about your operating system and computer architecture.
To get the version of OS X you are using, click on the apple icon
on the upper-left corner of the screen, then click on "About this Mac."
On Linux, you should be able to obtain most of this information using::

	uname -a

If you compiled BAMM on your system, please send us details about the compiler
you used. The compiler used is shown when you typed ``make`` and CMake reported
the compiler found. Most compilers have the option ``--version`` to print out
the version.

If BAMM actually begins to perform an analysis, then it will have generated
a detailed *run_info.txt* file that contains information about your analysis.
Please include this file in your post or e-mail.
